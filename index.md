## Short Bio

I am a Senior Research Engineer at [Runtime Verification Inc.](https://runtimeverification.com). I am currently working on the formal modeling and verification of blockchain and distributed systems (see  [projects](#) below). I received my MS and PhD degrees in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests are in applying formal methods to verification of software systems with the goal of improving software quality and reliability.
